# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust system for recognizing human emotions from speech audio. Emotions play a crucial role in human communication, and automatically identifying them can have significant applications in areas such as customer service, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. This system leverages deep learning techniques to analyze speech signals and classify them into various emotional states.

## Features

* **Audio Preprocessing:** Handles raw audio files, preparing them for feature extraction.
* **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant acoustic features (e.g., MFCCs, pitch, energy) from speech signals.
* **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, LSTMs or a combination) for emotion classification.
* **Emotion Classification:** Classifies speech into predefined emotional categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral, fearful, disgust, surprise).
* **Performance Evaluation:** Includes metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning Frameworks:**
    * TensorFlow
    * Keras
* **Data Manipulation & Analysis:**
    * NumPy
    * Pandas
* **Audio Processing Libraries:**
    * Librosa
    * SoundFile
* **Machine Learning Utilities:**
    * Scikit-learn
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and experimentation.

## Dataset
* **Name of Dataset:** [TESS]
* **Description:** Briefly describe the dataset(s) used, including the number of speakers, types of emotions covered, and approximate size.
* **Source:** Provide a link to the dataset if it's publicly available.

*Example:*
This project primarily uses the **Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)** dataset, which contains emotional speech and song from 24 professional actors (12 male, 12 female), uttering a standard set of sentences in a neutral North American accent. The emotions include calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised, and neutral.

## Model Architecture

*(**You need to elaborate on the specific model architecture used in your notebook.**)*

* **Type of Model:** [e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, or a hybrid CNN-LSTM model]
* **Layers:** Describe the layers used (e.g., Convolutional layers, Pooling layers, Dense layers, Dropout, Activation functions).
* **Input Shape:** Mention the expected input shape for the model (e.g., `(num_time_steps, num_features)` for RNNs or `(height, width, channels)` for CNNs on spectrograms).
* **Output Layer:** Number of neurons corresponding to emotional classes and the activation function (e.g., `softmax`).

*Example:*
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to process MFCC features. It consists of multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activations, followed by max-pooling layers to downsample the feature maps. Flattening leads to dense layers with dropout for regularization, culminating in a final dense layer with a softmax activation for classifying the 7 emotions.

## Results

*(**Summarize your key findings from the notebook. Include metrics like accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix observations, etc.**)*

*Example:*
The trained model achieved an accuracy of approximately **[Your Accuracy]%** on the test set. Analysis of the confusion matrix revealed [mention any specific insights, e.g., "higher accuracy for 'happy' and 'neutral' emotions, but some confusion between 'fearful' and 'angry'"].
